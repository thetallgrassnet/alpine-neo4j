## Docker image for Neo4j Community Edition

Based on the [official Neo4j Docker image](https://github.com/neo4j/docker-neo4j), built on [Alpine](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)
to minimize image size.

**Note: this image is a _work in progress_ beta, and is not suited for production use**

Neo4j is an highly scalable, robust (fully ACID) native graph
database. It is used in mission-critical apps by thousands of leading
startups, enterprises, and governments around the world. You can learn
more [here](http://neo4j.com/developer).

### Getting started

The image exposes two ports (`7474` and `7473`) for HTTP and HTTPS
access to the Neo4j API and a volume (`/data`) to allow the database
to be persisted outside its container.

```
<<<<<<< ours
git clone https://github.com/thetallgrassnet/alpine-neo4j
cd alpine-neo4j
docker build .
=======
docker run \
    --detach \
    --publish=7474:7474 \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j-data:/data \
    neo4j/neo4j
```
>>>>>>> theirs

Point your browser at `http://localhost:7474`.

Please note that by default Neo4j requires authentication. You have to
login with `neo4j/neo4j` at the first connection and set a new
password.

### Configuration

The image provides a useable default configuration for learning about
Neo4j, but it is not suitable for production use. You can read more
about configuring Neo4j in the
[manual](http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/configuration.html).

There are three ways to modify the configuration depending on how much
you need to customize the image.

#### Environment variables

Pass environment variables to the container when you run it.

```
docker run \
    --detach \
    --publish=7474:7474 \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j-data:/data \
    --env=NEO4J_CACHE_MEMORY=4G \
    neo4j/neo4j
```

The following environment variables are available:

* `NEO4J_CACHE_MEMORY`: the size of Neo4j's native-memory cache,
  defaults to 512M
* `NEO4J_HEAP_MEMORY`: the size of Neo4j's heap, defaults to the JVM
  default for your system
* `NEO4J_OPEN_FILES`: the maximum number of open filehandles, defaults
  to 4000
* `NEO4J_NO_AUTH`: turn off authentication by setting a value

#### `/conf` volume

To make arbitrary modifications to the Neo4j configuration, provide
the container with a `/conf` volume.

```
docker run \
    --detach \
    --publish=7474:7474 \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j-data:/data \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j-conf:/conf \
    neo4j/neo4j
```

The `/conf` volume will override all configuration provided by the
image and must therefore contain a complete, valid set of Neo4j
configuration files.

#### Build a new image

For more complex customization of the image you can create a new image
based on this one.

```
FROM neo4j/neoj4
```
